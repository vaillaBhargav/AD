                                   OPERATORS

Expration
operators
operand
operation

for ex== x = a + b
= and + are called as operators
x,a,b this are called operands

in avery expration thire will be the operators,operands, operations

operater == is the symble of denoting the operation betwen one or two operand


Arithmatic operators== used to make caluculations

                         + ,- , * , / , % , ** , //

ex==a=34
    b=545
    print(a*b)
output==18530

Comparison opperators== it is used to comperarison reslut all time boolean only

                       > , > , >= , <= ,== , != 

 ex== a=34
      b=355
      print(a>=b)

out put==False

  ex==a=34
      b=355
      print(a!=b)
out put==True

logical== combine conditional statments

truth tables

AND== TT=T
      TF=F
      FT=F
      FF=F
OR==  TT=T
      TF=T
      FT=T
      FF=F
NOT== T=F
      F=T

ex==x=6
    y=8
    x>6 and y<8
out put==False


identity=== is, isnot

Bitwise operators

&  AND
|  OR
^  XOR
~ NOT
<< left shift
>> right shift
